                      VeilPNG  - Pre-Installation Information
=============================================================

Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 10/7/2024

Thank you for choosing VeilPNG! Before you proceed with the installation, please carefully review the following information to ensure proper usage and compatibility of the software.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1. System Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Operating System: Windows 7, 8, 10, or later
- Processor: Intel/AMD dual-core processor or better
- RAM: 2GB minimum (4GB recommended)
- Disk Space: 50MB available for installation
- Additional Software: .NET Framework 4.5 or higher may be required

-------------------------------------------------------------
2. Important Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------

- **VeilPNG**: This tool embeds sensitive data into PNG images using custom PNG chunks and encryption. It ensures the image file remains valid and appears intact while securely storing your hidden data.
  
- **sVeil**: Similar to VeilPNG but optimized for scenarios where image appearance is less important than data security. sVeil appends hidden data directly to the trailing portion of the **IDAT** chunk within the PNG file. While this may slightly corrupt the image appearance, the integrity of the hidden data is paramount. Use strong passwords for maximum protection.

- Always use strong passwords when protecting sensitive information.
  
- Antivirus software may flag certain executable files due to the encryption mechanisms involved. Ensure VeilPNG and sVeil are allowed by your antivirus program to avoid disruptions.

**sVeil vs VeilPNG**

- **When to Use VeilPNG**:
  - Use VeilPNG when you want the embedded data to remain completely hidden while keeping the PNG image visually intact.
  - Ideal for use cases where maintaining the appearance and compatibility of the PNG file with various image viewers is critical.
  
- **When to Use sVeil**:
  - Use sVeil when secure storage of hidden data is the primary concern, even if the image may appear slightly corrupted.
  - This method appends the hidden file into the IDAT chunk's deflate stream, allowing secure file storage while still generating a valid PNG structure.
  - Recommended when the primary focus is secure data storage rather than image fidelity.
